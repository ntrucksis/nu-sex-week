    subtitle: 'MSTRBATION 101-6 – Masturbation for Manifestation',
    pic: "hello",
    desc: `Masturbation is a catalyst for radical self-love.
Masturbation as a ritual, healing modality, and a self-actualizing practice
enabling us to take back our power through sex-positive means!
Spiritually anchored, it transmutes sexual energy into unwavering life
force (manifestation)! It aligns the chakras, reminds us of our embodied
wisdom, to ignite our fullest potential. Because of it, we can be more
capable of giving, receiving, and experiencing love and all its flavours. Its
infinite wisdom and adoration for the body, mind, and spirit invites us to
go beyond the genitals so we can awaken the pleasures of everyday life.
Masturbation assesses our desires, it questions if we’re aligned with our
standards & our dignity. As a pillar of erotic consciousness, it honours
our complexities and asks that we do the same for others.
sex KiKi’s founder Coriama, is a pleasure activist, artist, and sensual
activator whose practice explores the ABCS (art, beauty, culture, and
sexuality). As a sensualist, Coriama utilizes various modalities that heavily
focus on spirituality and eroticism to highlight sexuality as a
healing art. She’s known for her masturbation philosophies and
 approach to building pleasure based communities.`,
